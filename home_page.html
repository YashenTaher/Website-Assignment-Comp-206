Welcome to the one and only SSMU Liquidation E-commerce Site! Due to the pointlessness of SSMU, we've all decided that it is for the best if we just dissolve it alltogether.<br>
We're all tired of the pointless referendums, scandals, and hyper-sensitivity towards issues that don't really matter. <br>
Our tuitions are expensive, it would be great if we didnt have to waste so much of it on this.<br>
We've got great deals! Ever wanted to pretend like you had power to change the world, and that your opinion mattered? Order unused ballots now for insane discounts! <br>
Ever wanted to own an over priced cafe so that you can spy on McGill students to relive those college years? <br>
Well thats on sale too. Hurry now before some old man with a mid-life crisis, looking to feel young again knabs this deal!!!!!!!
